# Trim 3D Gaussian Splatting for Accurate Geometry Representation

![Teaser image](assets/teaser.jpg)
TrimGS exhibits better geometric details and perceptual quality. In Figure (a) TrimGS separates the slender crossbars of a bench. Figure (b) showcases that TrimGS excels in rendering intricate details in both color and normals.

We are planning to release the complete code in a month. We believe this will allow us to polish our code to better serve the research community.
