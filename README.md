# Trim 3D Gaussian Splatting for Accurate Geometry Representation

![Teaser image](assets/teaser.jpg)
More demonstrations can be found on our [project page](https://trimgs.github.io/).

We are planning to release the complete code in a month. We believe this will allow us to polish our code to better serve the research community.

We will integrate TrimGS into more state-of-the-art methods to demonstrate its universality in the near future. 

## Acknowledgements

We sincerely thank the authors of the great works [3D Gaussian Splatting](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/) and [2D Gaussian Splatting](https://surfsplatting.github.io/). Our Trim3DGS and Trim2DGS are built upon these foundations.
